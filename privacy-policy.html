        <p>Last updated: August 10, 2025</p>

        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how your information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use my Apple iOS application. By using the app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>
            I do not collect or store any personal information from users of this app. The app does not require you to create an account or provide personal data such as your name, email, or address.
        </p>

        <h2>Analytics Data</h2>
        <p>
            The app may collect anonymous usage data (such as crash logs or error reports) to improve performance and reliability. This data does not identify you personally and is not shared with third parties except for trusted analytics providers.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            My app may use third-party services (such as Apple, or analytics providers) that collect information used to identify you. Please refer to their privacy policies for more detail.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            I value your trust in providing your information and strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. Remember, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
